 #Exam-Scheduling-system 
 
 Project in smart system 
Optimize university exam schedules to reduce student conflicts and evenly 
distribute workload using genetic algorithms.


Output:Optimized exam timetable with minimal student conflicts and even distribution of 
workload. 
 
  # Project Objectives:
Create a Conflict-Free Exam Schedule
➤ Ensure that no student has overlapping exams at the same time.

# Optimize Resource Utilization
➤ Distribute exams efficiently across classrooms to avoid overcrowding and underuse.

# Minimize Student Stress
➤ Spread exams over different days and times so students are not overloaded on a single day.

# Consider Course Sizes
➤ Assign appropriate classrooms based on course size (small, medium, large), avoiding small rooms for large courses.

# Ensure Balanced Scheduling of Large Courses
➤ Avoid scheduling multiple large courses simultaneously to reduce pressure on facilities and students.

# Prevent Exceeding Room Capacity
➤ Make sure the number of students does not exceed the capacity of the assigned classroom for safety and practicality.

# Generate Multiple Solutions and Find the Best Using Genetic Algorithm
➤ Explore many possible schedules and select the optimal ones based on multiple criteria (conflicts, balance, stress, capacity).

# Produce a Final Schedule That Can Be Exported and Reviewed
➤ Create a final exam schedule that can be saved as a CSV file and analyzed or visualized.

# Provide Visual Reports of the Schedule
➤ Present graphs showing exam distribution by day, student load, and classroom usage for better understanding.
